  Long ago, in the 15th century, Örebro Castle was a bustling hub of political
  and military activity. King Charles VIII ruled with a fair but iron hand,
  ensuring peace throughout his kingdom. However, within the castle walls, a
  dark secret festered, one that would soon unravel.

<p class="env-text-body-02">

  A skilled blacksmith named John lived in the village nearby. He was known for
  his exceptional craftsmanship, creating weapons and armor of unparalleled
  quality. John's talents earned him the respect and admiration of many,
  including the king. But John harbored a secret; he was deeply in love with
  Helena, a beautiful maiden who served as a lady-in-waiting at the castle.
</p>
<p class="env-text-body-03 separator">
  <mark class="typo"><span>body / 03</span></mark>
  Helena reciprocated John's feelings, and their love blossomed in secret.
  However, their happiness was short-lived. Sir Magnus, a high-ranking noble
  with a cruel disposition, also desired Helena. Consumed by jealousy and rage
  upon learning of Helena's love for John, Sir Magnus concocted a sinister plan.

  One cold winter's night, Sir Magnus accused John of forging counterfeit coins,
  a crime punishable by death. Despite his protests of innocence, John was
  imprisoned within the castle's dungeons, awaiting execution. Helena,
  distraught and desperate, pleaded with King Charles for mercy. Touched by her
  sorrow, the king agreed to spare John's life on one condition: John must
  create a sword of unparalleled strength and beauty within a month.
</p>
<p class="env-text-body-02">
  <mark class="typo"><span>body / 02</span></mark>
  John, determined to save his life and be with Helena, accepted the challenge.
  For weeks, he toiled tirelessly, pouring his heart and soul into his work.
  Finally, he crafted a sword so magnificent that it seemed to glow with an
  inner light. But as he presented the sword to the king, Sir Magnus intervened,
  sabotaging John's work by cursing the blade.

  The cursed sword brought misfortune to all who wielded it. One by one, the
  castle's knights fell to mysterious accidents and illnesses. Fear and
  suspicion spread throughout the castle, and whispers of a curse echoed through
  the halls. John, now realizing the true nature of Sir Magnus's evil, sought to
  break the curse.

  Helena, heartbroken but resolute, vowed to ensure that John's sacrifice was
  not in vain. She presented the cursed sword to King Charles, explaining the
  truth behind the curse. The king, deeply moved by their tragic love story,
  ordered the sword to be sealed within the castle's walls, never to be used
  again.

  Years later, a grand festival was held to commemorate the heroism and love of
  John and Helena. During this celebration, a blacksmith's forge was lit in the
  castle courtyard, symbolizing John's enduring spirit. This forge, known as the
  Eternal Flame, continues to burn bright, a beacon of hope and resilience.
  Local blacksmiths and artisans gather annually to pay homage, forging new
  creations in honor of John's legacy.
